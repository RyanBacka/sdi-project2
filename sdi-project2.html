<p>I chose to write a code about the condensation from natural gas that we gather and store as we go through a work day. I also included an output that can be sent to the land owners to let them know how much we made from their land. I also decided to use my process to end my program or loop it back through if you missed something.</p>
<p>Condensate is a very valuable liquid that is made from fall out of natural gas. It is used for many things and looks and smells a lot like a low grade gasoline. Most companies make more money from the condensate than from the actual gas extracted.</p>
